# Rock, Paper, Scissors game with Speech Recognition and Tkinter GUI

**Project Overview:**

This project features a Rock, Paper, Scissors game with both command-line and graphical user interface (GUI) implementations using Tkinter. The game allows users to play against the computer with the added functionality of voice commands, integrating speech recognition and text-to-speech features for a more interactive experience.

**Key Features:**

   - Command-Line and GUI Options: Users can play the game via a text-based interface or a visually appealing Tkinter-based GUI.
   - Speech Recognition: Utilizes the SpeechRecognition library to interpret user voice commands for game inputs.
   - Text-to-Speech Feedback: Employs pyttsx3 for converting game results into audible feedback, enhancing user interaction.
   - Game Logic: Implements core Rock, Paper, Scissors rules with random computer choices and outcome determination.

**Technologies Used:**

   - Tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface.
   - SpeechRecognition: For voice input functionality.
   - pyttsx3: For text-to-speech conversion.
   - Random Module: For generating computerâ€™s choices.
   - PyAudio: For handling audio streams.

**Methodology:**

   - Speech Recognition Integration: Captures and processes user voice input to determine game choices.
   - Game Logic: Determines the winner based on user and computer choices.
   - GUI Development: Displays choices and game outcomes, providing a user-friendly interface.
   - Exception Handling: Ensures robust performance and user-friendly error management.

**Results:** 

The project successfully creates an engaging Rock, Paper, Scissors game with effective voice command integration and a dynamic GUI, providing a novel gaming experience. Future enhancements could focus on improving speech recognition accuracy and GUI aesthetics, as well as incorporating game analytics for enhanced user engagement.
